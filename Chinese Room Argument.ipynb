    "üìÑ PDF Extraction\n",
    "Local PDF files are loaded and their textual content is extracted using the PyMuPDF library. The extracted text is then segmented into smaller, manageable chunks to facilitate semantic processing by embedding models and language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "üåê Google Search\n",
    "Based on the user‚Äôs query, the system performs a free Google search to retrieve the most relevant web pages. The top paragraphs from each page are scraped using requests and BeautifulSoup to supplement the PDF content with up-to-date, real-world information.\n",
    "\n",
    "üß† Embedding\n",
    "All text chunks‚Äîwhether from PDFs or web pages‚Äîare converted into vector embeddings using a pre-trained Sentence Transformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2). These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of each chunk, enabling effective similarity comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "üß† Vector DB (ChromaDB)\n",
    "ChromaDB is used to store the generated embeddings alongside their corresponding text chunks. During query time, the system retrieves the most relevant content by performing a similarity search against the user‚Äôs question embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "üí¨ Language Model\n",
    "A language model (accessed via GroqCloud) generates a contextualized answer by incorporating both the user‚Äôs question and the most relevant chunks retrieved from ChromaDB. This step leverages the model‚Äôs capacity to reason and respond in natural language.\n",

    "üñ•Ô∏è Main Interface\n",
    "All components are orchestrated into a streamlined question-answering pipeline. The interface handles PDF processing, online search, embedding generation, vector retrieval, and final answer generation‚Äîproviding an interactive and user-friendly experience."

      "The Chinese Room Argument\" is a thought experiment introduced by philosopher John Searle in 1980, which challenges the idea that computers or artificial intelligence (AI) can truly think or understand language. Here are the premises:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Premise 1:** Imagine a person who does not speak Chinese is locked in a room with a large set of rules and Chinese characters. This person receives Chinese input through a slot in the door and responds with Chinese output, also through the slot.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Premise 2:** The person inside the room does not understand Chinese, but is able to produce Chinese output by following the rules provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Premise 3:** The output produced by the person in the room is indistinguishable from the output produced by a native Chinese speaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Premise 4:** Despite the person in the room producing Chinese output that is indistinguishable from a native speaker, the person in the room does not truly understand Chinese.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:** Therefore, having a system that can process and produce output that is indistinguishable from human language does not necessarily mean that the system truly understands the language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Searle's argument is that even if a computer program can produce output that is indistinguishable from human language, it does not mean that the program truly understands the language. The Chinese Room thought experiment highlights the difference between processing and understanding language.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, the argument is that a system that can process and respond to language inputs, even with perfect accuracy, does not necessarily have true cognitive understanding or consciousness of the meaning of the language.\n",

      "6. Daniel Dennett - argued that Searle's argument relies on a mistaken understanding of artificial intelligence and the nature of computation.\n",
      "7. David Chalmers - argued that Searle's argument is based on an unrealistic assumption that the Chinese Room system lacks any kind of internal mental states.\n",
      "8. Stevan Harnad - argued that Searle's argument is a \"straw man\" attack on artificial intelligence.\n",
      "9. Paul Churchland - argued that Searle's argument is based on an outdated understanding of the nature of cognition and intelligence.\n",
