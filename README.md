# Training a RAG System Based on Llama-3-70B on the Chinese Room Argument

This project demonstrates how to build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline using the **Llama-3-70B** model to explore philosophical discourse, specifically the **Chinese Room Argument**. The system combines document processing, web search, semantic search, and LLM-based response generation to create an interactive and intelligent question-answering tool.

## Features

* ✅ PDF Document Extraction
* ✅ Real-Time Google Search Integration
* ✅ Semantic Embedding with Sentence Transformers
* ✅ Vector Storage with ChromaDB
* ✅ LLM-based Contextual Answer Generation
* ✅ User-Friendly Interactive Pipeline

---

## 📄 PDF Extraction

Local PDF files (e.g., academic papers on the Chinese Room Argument) are parsed using **[PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/)** to extract raw text. This text is then split into manageable chunks for downstream embedding and retrieval tasks.

---

## 🌐 Google Search Integration

To enrich the context beyond static documents, the pipeline performs **real-time Google searches** using your query. The top-ranked web pages are scraped with `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`, and relevant paragraphs are extracted for semantic matching.

---

## 🧠 Text Embedding

All textual chunks—whether from PDFs or the web—are embedded into vector representations using **[Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/)** (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`). These embeddings allow the system to capture semantic relationships and retrieve the most relevant information at query time.

---

## 📦 Vector Database (ChromaDB)

The vector embeddings and associated text chunks are stored in **[ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/)**. During a user query, similarity search is performed to retrieve the most contextually relevant chunks based on embedding distance.

---

## 💬 Language Model (Llama-3-70B via GroqCloud)

The retrieved context, combined with the user’s question, is passed to **Llama-3-70B** (accessed via **[GroqCloud](https://groq.com/groqcloud/)**). The model generates a thoughtful and well-reasoned response, grounded in the retrieved content.

---

## 🖥️ Interactive Pipeline

All components—PDF parsing, web search, embedding, retrieval, and answer generation—are orchestrated into a unified pipeline. The system allows for:

* Uploading and parsing documents
* Live web augmentation
* Contextualized question answering
* Seamless end-to-end integration

---


## 🧪 Example Use Case

**Question:**

> *"Does the Chinese Room Argument disprove strong AI?"*

**Answer (generated):**

> *"The Chinese Room Argument challenges the notion that syntactic processing alone constitutes understanding, suggesting that a system could appear intelligent without genuine comprehension..."*
